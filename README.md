Website name: Studie

Studie is a study software website, the software developed by Studie is essentially an all in one study platform with tools likes notes, flashcards and wikis.

Studie aims to create a versatile platform to make learning a simple and enjoyable process for students in order to promote life long learning.

The main goal of the Studie website is to get people to download their software to increase their user base. The website allows people to read about the various tools Studie offers, they can even demo out some of the tools on the website itself.

Design Process:
The Studie website is mainly targeted at students as the main product it offers is a software to help people study better.

The theme/design for the Studie website is modern and minimalistic. This will help give off the impression that the software is modern and simplistic to potential users. Most of the time when studying we want to be organised, so being simple will let users feel like they can be organised as the tools and features of the website will not be complicated to handle.

    (1) As a user, I want to try out the demos to test out the software.

    (2) As a user, I want to sign up for the newsletter to get regular updates.

    (3) As a user, I want to read up more about the company's background.
